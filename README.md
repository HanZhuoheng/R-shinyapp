I choose the Makeup API. This app can help you fliter the product by product_type, brand, price_higher_than, and price_less_than. Also, you can just enter the product name, then get the product information. If some users just make decisions on which product_type they are going to buy, the app will give the scatter plots of price difference and the rating comparing  between different brands in order to help users to make better decisions. Also, there is a pie chart for the proportion of the product_type in the brand. In this way, users can know which product_type that brand sells most.
